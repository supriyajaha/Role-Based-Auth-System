# Role-Based-Auth-System
Create a role based authorization system to restrict access to certain resources

Implement a role based auth system. System should be able to assign a role to user and remove a user from the role.

Entities are USER, ACTION TYPE, RESOURCE, ROLE

ACTION TYPE defines the access level(Ex: READ, WRITE, DELETE)

Access to resources for users are controlled strictly by the role.One user can have multiple roles. Given a user, action type and resource system should be able to tell whether user has access or not.

Please list down the assumptions made. Scope out things if you feel this takes more than 3 hours and add them to assumptions.

Note:
1. Use any object oriented programming language.
2. Code should be maintainable and production ready
3. Follow the best practices of engineering and design patterns.
